# Behavioral pattern
     1)  In software engineering, behavioural design patterns are **design patterns** that identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these 
         patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication. Below are some of them
               i) Strategy Pattern
               ii) Template Pattern
               iii) Command Pattern
               
# Software design pattern
      1) A software design pattern is a **general, reusable solution** to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
# Strategy Pattern
      1) The strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
      2) Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.
      3) The concept of using design patterns to describe how to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software
      4) Deferring the decision about which algorithm to use until runtime makes the calling code more flexible and reusable.
